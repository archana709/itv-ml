    "\n",
    "4.What is the use of PEP 8 in Python?\n",
    "Ans-Image result for What is the use of PEP 8 in Python?\n",
    "PEP 8, sometimes spelled PEP8 or PEP-8, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What is Pickling in Python?\n",
    "Ans-Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. ... Pickling is a way to convert a python object   (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.How does memory management work in Python?\n",
    "Ans- Each object has its own object-specific memory allocator that knows how to get the memory to store that object. Each object also has an object-specific memory deallocator that “frees” the memory once it’s no longer needed.\n",
    "The operating system (OS) abstracts the physical memory and creates a virtual memory layer that applications (including Python) can access.\n",
    "\n",
    "An OS-specific virtual memory manager carves out a chunk of memory for the Python process. The darker gray boxes in the image below are now owned by the Python process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks to Show Different Areas of Memory with Object Memory Highlighted\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a portion of the memory for internal use and non-object memory. The other portion is dedicated to object storage (your int, dict, and the like). Note that this was somewhat simplified. If you want the full picture, you can check out the CPython source code, where all this memory management happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython has an object allocator that is responsible for allocating memory within the object memory area. This object allocator is where most of the magic happens. It gets called every time a new object needs space allocated or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the adding and removing of data for Python objects like list and int doesn’t involve too much data at a time. So the design of the allocator is tuned to work well with small amounts of data at a time. It also tries not to allocate memory until it’s absolutely required.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.How will you perform Static Analysis on a Python Script?\n",
    "\n",
    "8.What is the difference between a Tuple and List in Python?\n",
    "Ans-List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. []\n",
    "    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. ()\n",
    "\n",
    "9.What is a Python Decorator?\n",
    "Ans-We can use the @ symbol along with the name of the decorator function and place it above the definition of the function to be decorated. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "@make_pretty\n",
    "def ordinary():\n",
    "    print(\"I am ordinary\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.How are arguments passed in a Python method? By value or by reference?\n",
    "Ans-By value\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What is the difference between List and Dictionary data types in Python?\n",

    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What is a Namespace in Python?\n",
    "Ans-Namespaces. Generally speaking, a namespace (sometimes also called a context) is a naming system for making names unique to avoid ambiguity. ... Namespaces in Python are implemented as Python dictionaries, this means it is a mapping from names (keys) to objects (values)\n",
    "\n",
    "global names of a module\n",
    "local names in a function or method invocation\n",
    "built-in names: this namespace contains built-in functions (e.g. abs(), cmp(), ...) and built-in exception names\n",
    "\n",
    "14.How will you concatenate multiple strings together in Python?\n",
    "Ans-str1 = “Hello”\n",
    "str2 = “World”\n",
    "str1 + str2\n",
    "\n",
    "by adding + operator\n",
    "\n",
    "15.What is the use of Pass statement in Python?\n",
    "Ans-The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "16.What is the use of Slicing in Python?\n",
    "Ans-Python slice() The slice() constructor creates a slice object representing the set of indices specified by range(start, stop, step). The slice object is used to slice a given sequence (string, bytes, tuple, list or range) or any object which supports sequence protocol (implements __getitem__() and __len__() method).\n",
    "\n",
    "17.What is the difference between Docstring in Python and Javadoc in Java?\n",
    "Ans-same it is,Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods.\n",
    "It’s specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. \n",
